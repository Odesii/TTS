## Concept

### Gameplay Overview

- top-down *rouge light* in the vein of **Enter the Gungeon** / Zelda with PVP
- arena with monsters to fight and collect '**LOOT**' from them 
- players are all stuck in the arena until a certain amount of time then they have to make it to an exit with all the collected goods to be able to keep them and upgrade(*extraction shooter style*).


### Mechanic ideas
- **Gameplay:**
	- Start in a 'wizard study'
		- areas for '*crafting*' and upgrades.
	- Loading into the arena:
		- there are roaming enemies and random chest for looting. 
		- Minimum time in before you can extract
		- Multiple Players spawn in randomly across the map
- <span style="color: 38761D">Player:</span>
	- magic 
	- projectiles
	- melee
- <span style="color: red" >LOOT:</span>
	- potions hp/mana
	- gold for upgrades
	- *(Deeper mechanic)* Monster parts for potion crafting / spell crafting.
- #### Interesting Ideas 
	- water has a kill-box
	- **Sound Effects:** ‚ùì
	    - Combat sounds for spells, weapons, and enemy attacks.
	    - Environmental sounds to enhance immersion.
### User Interface

- **HUD:**
    - Health and mana bars
    - Inventory system for managing loot and crafting materials
    - In-game menu for crafting, upgrading, and character customization.
